Description reNgine is an automated reconnaissance framework with a focus on a highly configurable streamlined recon process. reNgine is backed by a database, with data correlation and organization, the custom query \u201clike\u201d language for recon data filtering, reNgine aims to address the shortcomings of traditional recon workflow. Developers behind the reNgine understand that recon data can be huge, manually looking up for entries to attack could be cumbersome, with features like Auto Interesting Subdomains discovery, reNgine automatically identifies interesting subdomains to attack based on certain keywords (both built-in and custom) and helps penetration testers focus on attack rather than recon. reNgine is also focused on continuous monitoring. Penetration testers can choose to schedule the scan at periodic intervals, get notified on notification channels like Discord, Slack, and Telegram for any new subdomains or vulnerabilities identified, or any recon data changes. Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. Beginning reNgine 1.0, we additionally developed features such as import and export subdomains, endpoints, GF pattern matched endpoints, etc. This will allow you to use your favourite recon workflow in conjunction with reNgine. reNgine features Highly configurable scan engines based on YAML, that allows penetration testers to create as many recon engines as they want of their choice, configure as they wish, and use it against any targets for the scan. These engines allow penetration testers to use tools of their choice, the configuration of their choice. Out of the box, reNgine comes with several scan engines like Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot gathering, OSINT Engine, etc. Our focus has always been on finding the right recon data with very minimal effort. While having a discussion with fellow hackers/pentesters, screenshots gallery was a must, reNgine 1.0 also comes with a screenshot gallery, and what's exciting than having a screenshot gallery with filters, filter screenshots with HTTP status, technology, ports, and services. We also want our fellow hackers to stay ahead of the game, reNgine 1.0 introduces automatic vulnerability reporting (currently only Hackerone is supported, other platforms may come soon). This allows hackers to define their own vulnerability report template and reNgine will do the rest of the job to report vulnerability as soon as it is identified.

In a nutshell, 1.0, is feature-packed with a lot of exciting features that are sure to ease your recon game. You may watch the trailer here Introducing Dark Mode, a feature you all have been asking for, is finally here. Recon Data visualization Recon Data visualization is the representation of recon data like subdomain, ips, endpoints, ports, vulnerabilities etc into the visual format like Trees and Charts. Improved correlation among recon data A considerable amount of effort has been spent on making sure that the correlation between recon data is consistent. With this improved correlation, you will now be able to identify recon data like, how many of the subdomains uses X as technology, how many of the subdomains use X.X.X.X as IP, etc. This also means that you will be able to see the number of vulnerabilities that a subdomain has, right from the subdomain table. Ability to identify Interesting Subdomains. reNgine uses certain keywords like admin, cpanel, ftp, dashboard to find what is interesting for you. Users will also be able to add their own keywords and choose conditions like, \"A subdomain in an interesting subdomain if it matches this keyword but also HTTP status is 200\". This allows you to identify what's the most important subdomains to attack against and super useful if you have a very large number of subdomains. Ability to Automatically report Vulnerabilities to Hackerone with customizable vulnerability report. I am excited about the possibilities of Hackerone api, this feature allows you to automatically report the vulnerability to HackerOne if a Critical or High vulnerability is found. Stay ahead of the game! What's exciting is that you also have an option to edit the vulnerability report. To prevent spamming triagers, I've made sure that only Critical and High vulnerabilities are reported. While you will still have an option to manually report the rest of the vulnerabilities. Introducing OSINT Capabilities OSINT is one of the most required features in any recon engine, and beginning 1.0, reNgine comes with OSINT capabilities. This includes support for Dorking, Employees, Emails, Leaked Passwords, etc to be searched. Recon Todo A good recon engine also requires a Todo feature, the idea is that you will be able to recon, add your recon todo or notes right inside reNgine. You will have an option to add todo for your Scan History, for your particular subdomain, or just a TODO! Anything is supported. You can also prioritize by making the Todo important. Proxy Support Proxies are an integral part of any web scraping. Every website has a limit to the certain number of requests for a certain period of time from a particular IP Address that it will allow, exceeding the limit will block incoming requests from such IP Address for a specific period of time. And this is especially true for Dorking and other OSINT reNgine does. After certain Dorking attempts Google is likely to ban your IP for a certain period of time. So using a proxy was a must. Introducing proxy support for reNgine, you will have an option to add hundreds of proxies, and reNgine will pick one of them randomly during the scan. GF support GF is an awesome tool for pattern matching in URLs! A lot of fellow hackers wanted GF support in reNgine. We now bring GF support with an option to upload your own custom GF template. Screenshot Gallery with Filters This probably was the most requested feature in reNgine. A recon engine is incomplete without a screenshot gallery. I am also excited to let you know that, the screenshot gallery also comes with filters, you will have an option to add filters like HTTP status, IP Address, Port, Services, and Technology. And, filters will also come with an autosuggestion feature. Powerful recon data filtering with auto-suggestions Recon data filtering was one of the most important features in reNgine, recon data is huge, and we do not want you to get lost, or spend a lot of time looking for the right recon data. So, presenting you, recon data filtering with autosuggestions. You will now be able to see a search bar in Subdomains Table, URLs, Vulnerabilities Table which will auto-suggest the col names. You can combine multiple queries using &, |, etc. Example gf_patterns=lfi&http_status=200&content_length>0 The possibilities are endless... Recon Data changes, finds new/removed subdomains/endpoints reNgine will now compare your last two scans to find out the recon data changes. You will have an option to send the changes to your notification channels as well. Super helpful while doing continuous monitoring on a target. Inside the scan dashboard, you will now see a separate section for Recon Data changes, which will identify any added or removed subdomains or endpoints. Tagging of targets into Organization There are times when you wish to perform a scan for all the targets that belong to an organization. reNgine 1.0 allows you to tag multiple targets to an organization and initiate or schedule scans with one click. Support for custom GF patterns and Nuclei Templates While nuclei was a part of the earlier release, but there wasn't any easy way to upload your custom nuclei templates. Now, you will have an option to add your custom GF or Nuclei templates right from the UI. You will also have an option to view the template. Support for editing tool-related configuration files (Nuclei, Subfinder, Naabu, amass) Tools like Nuclei, Subfinder uses configuration files to pass API keys and certain tool-related settings. We now bring an option to directly edit tool-related configuration files right from reNgine UI. This means you will also be able to view them. Option to Mark Subdomains as important This is a tiny little feature that will allow you to mark any subdomain as important! Watch out for a star icon on the subdomains table, you'll be able to mark them as important. Separate tab for Directory scan results It is true that directory scan results were breaking the subdomains table, from a UX perspective, it was not a really good idea to show everything in the subdomains table. So, a new tab has been added just for directory scan results. Option to Import and Export Subdomains and export endpoints Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. You will now be able to import subdomains from your private recon tools to any scan before you initiate. You will see this option to import the subdomain just after you choose the scan engine. In the same section, you will also see an option to exclude subdomains. We also now allow you to download subdomains, or just download subdomains marked as important, or just download subdomains that are interesting. This also applies to endpoints, you can download all endpoints, just download any endpoints that have certain GF patterns matched. Clean your scan results and screenshots I understand most of you run reNgine on your VPS, and it is very understandable that you wish to clean scan results, screenshots to save up some space. reNgine now allows you to clean up your scan data and/or screenshots. Enhanced and Customizable Scan alert with support for Slack, Discord & Telegram, also send recon data directly to Discord Notification in the earlier version of reNgine was not very efficient, and support was only for slack. reNgine 1.0 comes with support for Slack, Discord, and Telegram. You will also have an option to customize what kind of notification to be sent, only want vulnerability-related notifications? You can choose that, only want subdomains changes? You can choose them as well. You also have an option to upload these scan data directly to your discord. You can view the complete changelog here: https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md There are a lot more tiny improvements that I worked on for several months that are sure to give you a better experience, and let you stay ahead in the recon game! I really appreciate any feedback and suggestions. \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.3 Release Date: Feb 25 2021 Build error for Naabu v2 Fixed Added rate support for Naabu \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.2 Release Date: Feb 23 2021 Fixed XSS https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/issues/347 \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.1 Release Date: Feb 19 2021 Features Added Discord Support for Notification Web hooks \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5 Release Date: 29 Nov 2020 Nuclei Integration: v0.5 is primarily focused on vulnerability scanner using Nuclei. This was a long pending due and we've finally integrated it. Powerful search queries across endpoints, subdomains and vulnerability scan results: reNgine reconnaissance data can now be queried using operators like <,>,&,| and !, namely greater than, less than, and, or, and not. This is extremely useful in querying the recon data. More details can be found at Instructions to perform Queries on Recon data Out of scope options: Many of you have been asking for out of scope option. Thanks to Valerio Brussani for his pull request which made it possible for out of scope options. Please check the documentation on how to define out of scope options. Official Documentation(WIP): We often get asked on how to use reNgine. For long, we had no official documentation. Finally, I've worked on it and we have the official documentation at rengine.wiki The documentation is divided into two parts, for Developers and for Penetration Testers. For developers, it's a work in progress. I will keep you all updated throughout the process. Redefined Dashboard: We've also made some changes in the Dashboard. The additions include vulnerability scan results, most vulnerable targets, most common vulnerabilities. Global Search: This feature has been one of the most requested features for reNgine. Now you can search all the subdomains, endpoints, and vulnerabilities. OneForAll Support: reNgine now supports OneForAll for subdomain discovery, it is currently in beta. I am working on how to integrate OneForAll APIKeys and Configuration files. Configuration Support for subfinder: You will now have ability to add configurations for subfinder as well. Timeout option for aquatone: We added timeout options in yaml configuration as a lot of screenshots were missing. You can now define timeout for http, scan and screenshots for timeout in milliseconds. Design Changes A lot of design changes has happened in reNgine. Some of which are: Endpoints Results and Vulnerability Scan Results are now displayed as a separate page, this is to separate the results and decrease the page load time. Checkbox next to Subdomains and Vulnerability report list to change the status, this allows you to mark all subdomains and vulnerabilities that you've already completed working on. Sometimes due to timeout, aquatone was skipping the screenshots and due to that, navigations between screenshots was little annoying. We have fixed it as well. Ability to delete multiple targets and initiate multiple scans. Subdomain Takeover (Removed): As we decided to use Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanner, and also, since Subjack wasn't giving enough results, I decided to remove Subjack. The subdomain Takeover will now be part of Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner. \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.4 Release Date: 2020-10-08 Features Background tasks migrated to Celery and redis Periodic and clocked scan added Ability to Stop and delete the scan CNAME and IP address added on detail scan Content type added on Endpoints section Ability to initiate multiple scans at a time \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.3 Release Date: 2020-07-21 Features YAML based Customization Engine Ability to add wordlists Login Feature \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.2 Release Date: 2020-07-11 Features Directory Search Enabled Fetch URLS using hakrawler Subdomain takeover using Subjack Add Bulk urls Delete Scan functionality Fix Windows Installation issue fixed Scrollbar Issue on small screens fixed \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.1 Release Date: 2020-07-08 reNgine is released","title":"Changelog/What's new"},{"location":"changelog/#changelog","text":"This section contains the changes happened in reNgine.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#backwards-compatibility-check","text":"Please ensure backwards compatibility before updating reNgine.

This was a long pending due and we've finally integrated it. Powerful search queries across endpoints, subdomains and vulnerability scan results: reNgine reconnaissance data can now be queried using operators like <,>,&,| and !, namely greater than, less than, and, or, and not. This is extremely useful in querying the recon data. More details can be found at Instructions to perform Queries on Recon data Out of scope options: Many of you have been asking for out of scope option. Thanks to Valerio Brussani for his pull request which made it possible for out of scope options. Please check the documentation on how to define out of scope options. Official Documentation(WIP): We often get asked on how to use reNgine. For long, we had no official documentation. Finally, I've worked on it and we have the official documentation at rengine.wiki The documentation is divided into two parts, for Developers and for Penetration Testers. For developers, it's a work in progress. I will keep you all updated throughout the process. Redefined Dashboard: We've also made some changes in the Dashboard. The additions include vulnerability scan results, most vulnerable targets, most common vulnerabilities. Global Search: This feature has been one of the most requested features for reNgine. Now you can search all the subdomains, endpoints, and vulnerabilities. OneForAll Support: reNgine now supports OneForAll for subdomain discovery, it is currently in beta. I am working on how to integrate OneForAll APIKeys and Configuration files. Configuration Support for subfinder: You will now have ability to add configurations for subfinder as well. Timeout option for aquatone: We added timeout options in yaml configuration as a lot of screenshots were missing. You can now define timeout for http, scan and screenshots for timeout in milliseconds. Design Changes A lot of design changes has happened in reNgine. Some of which are: Endpoints Results and Vulnerability Scan Results are now displayed as a separate page, this is to separate the results and decrease the page load time. Checkbox next to Subdomains and Vulnerability report list to change the status, this allows you to mark all subdomains and vulnerabilities that you've already completed working on. Sometimes due to timeout, aquatone was skipping the screenshots and due to that, navigations between screenshots was little annoying. We have fixed it as well. Ability to delete multiple targets and initiate multiple scans. Subdomain Takeover (Removed): As we decided to use Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanner, and also, since Subjack wasn't giving enough results, I decided to remove Subjack. The subdomain Takeover will now be part of Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner.","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5"},{"location":"changelog/#04","text":"Release Date: 2020-10-08 Features Background tasks migrated to Celery and redis Periodic and clocked scan added Ability to Stop and delete the scan CNAME and IP address added on detail scan Content type added on Endpoints section Ability to initiate multiple scans at a time","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.4"},{"location":"changelog/#03","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-21 Features YAML based Customization Engine Ability to add wordlists Login Feature","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.3"},{"location":"changelog/#02","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-11 Features Directory Search Enabled Fetch URLS using hakrawler Subdomain takeover using Subjack Add Bulk urls Delete Scan functionality Fix Windows Installation issue fixed Scrollbar Issue on small screens fixed","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.2"},{"location":"changelog/#01","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-08 reNgine is released","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.1"},{"location":"community/blog-videos/","text":"Blogs and Videos Published by the community This section contains blogs and videos published by the community.

Quick Installation You can skip prerequisites if you are running Ubuntu This document is firther divided into 3 parts: Prerequisites Quick Installation reNgine Installation Prerequisites reNgine uses several scripts and tools, those tools or scripts rely on various tools to be installed like Go, Python, etc, and to avoid any dependency issues, we decided to use Docker. Using Docker will not only ease the dependency issues but will also ease the installation steps. As a penetration tester, you need not focus on solving the dependencies, installing required tools, etc. With few installation steps, you should be good to run reNgine . reNgine requires 3 tools to be installed before you begin installing rengine. They are, docker, docker-compose and make utility. Docker Docker provides very good documentation on how to install docker based on your Operating System. You can follow the documentation here. Docker installation on Ubuntu/Linux Distributions Warning The installation steps have been directly taken from Docker Guide with no modification.

Please carry out these steps before installing reNgine Create a database cluster. Login to your digitalocean account and click on Databases on left navigation menu. Click on Create Database Cluster button. Choose PostgreSQL Click on Create Database Cluster button. Click on Get Started. Choose your inbound connection to the database cluster. This must be either VPS IP address or IP address of your local machine wherever reNgine is running. Note down your credentials, you'll need to put these details in .env file. Also, if your managed database only connects via SSL, please click on Download CA certificate. Finish the steps. Now you have a managed database cluster, and you need these credentials to put it in .env file. Sample .env file with managed database cluster credentials COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=rengine AUTHORITY_NAME=reNgine AUTHORITY_PASSWORD=nSrmNkwT COMPANY=reNgine DOMAIN_NAME=recon.example.com COUNTRY_CODE=US STATE=Georgia CITY=Atlanta POSTGRES_DB=defaultdb POSTGRES_USER=doadmin POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sfga69d121960is9cs9kc POSTGRES_PORT=5432 POSTGRES_HOST=db-postgresql-nyc3-XXXXX-do-user-8362215-0.b.db.ondigitalocean.com That is all you need, You should now be able to connect to the database from reNgine, But, if you databases uses SSL connection, there is an extra step to be done. Move your CA certificate to reNgine's web root directory cd rengine/web && mv ~/Downloads/ca-certificate.crt . Open reNgine settings.py file inside rengine/web/reNgine Find this line DATABASES = { 'default': { 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql', 'NAME': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_DB'), 'USER': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_USER'), 'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_PASSWORD'), 'HOST': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_HOST'), 'PORT': os.environ.get('POSTGRES_PORT'), # 'OPTIONS':{ # 'sslmode':'verify-full', # 'sslrootcert': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'ca-certificate.crt') # } } } and uncomment OPTIONS as below.
