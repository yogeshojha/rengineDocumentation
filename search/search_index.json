Description \u00b6 reNgine is a web application reconnaissance suite with a focus on a highly configurable streamlined recon process. reNgine is backed by a database, with data correlation and organization, the custom query \u201clike\u201d language for recon data filtering, reNgine aims to address the shortcomings of traditional recon workflow. Developers behind the reNgine understand that recon data can be huge, manually looking up for entries to attack could be cumbersome, with features like identifying Interesting Subdomains, it helps penetration testers focus on attack rather than recon. reNgine is also focused on continuous monitoring. Penetration testers can choose to schedule the scan at periodic intervals, get notified on notification channels like Discord, Slack, and Telegram for any new subdomains or vulnerabilities identified, or any recon data changes. Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. Beginning reNgine 1.0, we additionally developed features such as import and export subdomains, endpoints, GF pattern matched endpoints, etc. This will allow you to use your favourite recon workflow in conjunction with reNgine. PDF reports are something every individual or a team needs. Beginning reNgine 1.1, reNgine also comes with option to download PDF reports. One can also choose the type of report, Full Scan Report or just reconnaissance report. Also, we understand that PDF reports needs to be customizable. Choose the color of report you like, customize the executive summary, etc. reNgine features Highly configurable scan engines based on YAML, that allows penetration testers to create as many recon engines as they want of their choice, configure as they wish, and use it against any targets for the scan. These engines allow penetration testers to use tools of their choice, the configuration of their choice. Out of the box, reNgine comes with several scan engines like Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot gathering, OSINT Engine, etc. Our focus has always been on finding the right recon data with very minimal effort. After having several discussions with fellow hackers/pentesters, screenshots gallery was a must, reNgine also comes with a screenshot gallery, and what's exciting than having a screenshot gallery with filters, filter screenshots with HTTP status, technology, ports, and services. We also want our fellow hackers to stay ahead of the game, reNgine also comes with automatic vulnerability reporting (currently only Hackerone is supported, other platforms may come soon). This allows hackers to define their own vulnerability report template and reNgine will do the rest of the job to report vulnerability as soon as it is identified. \u2b50 Features \u00b6 reNgine is packed with features that no any open other source tool provides. Here are some list of cool features supported by reNgine: Reconnaissance: Subdomain Discovery, IP and Open Ports Identification, Endpoints Discovery, Directory and Files fuzzing, Screenshot gathering, Vulnerability scan using Nuclei, WHOIS Identification etc. Highly configurable YAML based Scan Engines Support for Parallel Scans and Subscans Automatically report Vulnerabilities to Hackerone Recon Data visualization OSINT Capabilities (Metainfo Gathering, Employees Gathering, Email Address with option to look password in leaked database, dorks etc) Customizable Alerts/Notification on Slack, Discord and Telegram Perform Advanced Query lookup using natural language alike and, or, not operations Recon Notes and Todos Clocked Scans (Run reconnaissance exactly at X Hours and Y minutes) and Periodic Scans (Runs reconnaissance every X minutes/hours/days/week) Proxy Support Screenshot Gallery with Filters Powerful recon data filtering with auto suggestions Recon Data changes, finds new/removed subdomains/endpoints Tag targets into Organization Identify Interesting Subdomains Custom GF patterns and custom Nuclei Templates Edit tool related configuration files (Nuclei, Subfinder, Naabu, amass) Add external tools from Github/Go Interoperable with other tools, Import/Export Subdomains/Endpoints Import Targets via IP and/or CIDRs Report Generation Toolbox : Comes bundled with most commonly used tools such as whois lookup, CMS detector, CVE lookup etc. Identification of related domains and related TLDs for targets Find actionable insights such as Most Common Vulnerability, Most Common CVE ID, Most Vulnerable Target/Subdomain etc. Tip Follow me on Twitter to keep yourself updated about new features. \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started \u00b6 If this is your first time visiting reNgine, here is a guide on \ud83d\ude80 Getting Started .

In a nutshell, 1.0, is feature-packed with a lot of exciting features that are sure to ease your recon game. You may watch the trailer here Introducing Dark Mode, a feature you all have been asking for, is finally here. Recon Data visualization Recon Data visualization is the representation of recon data like subdomain, ips, endpoints, ports, vulnerabilities etc into the visual format like Trees and Charts. Improved correlation among recon data A considerable amount of effort has been spent on making sure that the correlation between recon data is consistent. With this improved correlation, you will now be able to identify recon data like, how many of the subdomains uses X as technology, how many of the subdomains use X.X.X.X as IP, etc. This also means that you will be able to see the number of vulnerabilities that a subdomain has, right from the subdomain table. Ability to identify Interesting Subdomains. reNgine uses certain keywords like admin, cpanel, ftp, dashboard to find what is interesting for you. Users will also be able to add their own keywords and choose conditions like, \"A subdomain in an interesting subdomain if it matches this keyword but also HTTP status is 200\". This allows you to identify what's the most important subdomains to attack against and super useful if you have a very large number of subdomains. Ability to Automatically report Vulnerabilities to Hackerone with customizable vulnerability report. I am excited about the possibilities of Hackerone api, this feature allows you to automatically report the vulnerability to HackerOne if a Critical or High vulnerability is found. Stay ahead of the game! What's exciting is that you also have an option to edit the vulnerability report. To prevent spamming triagers, I've made sure that only Critical and High vulnerabilities are reported. While you will still have an option to manually report the rest of the vulnerabilities. Introducing OSINT Capabilities OSINT is one of the most required features in any recon engine, and beginning 1.0, reNgine comes with OSINT capabilities. This includes support for Dorking, Employees, Emails, Leaked Passwords, etc to be searched. Recon Todo A good recon engine also requires a Todo feature, the idea is that you will be able to recon, add your recon todo or notes right inside reNgine. You will have an option to add todo for your Scan History, for your particular subdomain, or just a TODO! Anything is supported. You can also prioritize by making the Todo important. Proxy Support Proxies are an integral part of any web scraping. Every website has a limit to the certain number of requests for a certain period of time from a particular IP Address that it will allow, exceeding the limit will block incoming requests from such IP Address for a specific period of time. And this is especially true for Dorking and other OSINT reNgine does. After certain Dorking attempts Google is likely to ban your IP for a certain period of time. So using a proxy was a must. Introducing proxy support for reNgine, you will have an option to add hundreds of proxies, and reNgine will pick one of them randomly during the scan. GF support GF is an awesome tool for pattern matching in URLs! A lot of fellow hackers wanted GF support in reNgine. We now bring GF support with an option to upload your own custom GF template. Screenshot Gallery with Filters This probably was the most requested feature in reNgine. A recon engine is incomplete without a screenshot gallery. I am also excited to let you know that, the screenshot gallery also comes with filters, you will have an option to add filters like HTTP status, IP Address, Port, Services, and Technology. And, filters will also come with an autosuggestion feature. Powerful recon data filtering with auto-suggestions Recon data filtering was one of the most important features in reNgine, recon data is huge, and we do not want you to get lost, or spend a lot of time looking for the right recon data. So, presenting you, recon data filtering with autosuggestions. You will now be able to see a search bar in Subdomains Table, URLs, Vulnerabilities Table which will auto-suggest the col names. You can combine multiple queries using &, |, etc. Example gf_patterns=lfi&http_status=200&content_length>0 The possibilities are endless... Recon Data changes, finds new/removed subdomains/endpoints reNgine will now compare your last two scans to find out the recon data changes. You will have an option to send the changes to your notification channels as well. Super helpful while doing continuous monitoring on a target. Inside the scan dashboard, you will now see a separate section for Recon Data changes, which will identify any added or removed subdomains or endpoints. Tagging of targets into Organization There are times when you wish to perform a scan for all the targets that belong to an organization. reNgine 1.0 allows you to tag multiple targets to an organization and initiate or schedule scans with one click. Support for custom GF patterns and Nuclei Templates While nuclei was a part of the earlier release, but there wasn't any easy way to upload your custom nuclei templates. Now, you will have an option to add your custom GF or Nuclei templates right from the UI. You will also have an option to view the template. Support for editing tool-related configuration files (Nuclei, Subfinder, Naabu, amass) Tools like Nuclei, Subfinder uses configuration files to pass API keys and certain tool-related settings. We now bring an option to directly edit tool-related configuration files right from reNgine UI. This means you will also be able to view them. Option to Mark Subdomains as important This is a tiny little feature that will allow you to mark any subdomain as important! Watch out for a star icon on the subdomains table, you'll be able to mark them as important. Separate tab for Directory scan results It is true that directory scan results were breaking the subdomains table, from a UX perspective, it was not a really good idea to show everything in the subdomains table. So, a new tab has been added just for directory scan results. Option to Import and Export Subdomains and export endpoints Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. You will now be able to import subdomains from your private recon tools to any scan before you initiate. You will see this option to import the subdomain just after you choose the scan engine. In the same section, you will also see an option to exclude subdomains. We also now allow you to download subdomains, or just download subdomains marked as important, or just download subdomains that are interesting. This also applies to endpoints, you can download all endpoints, just download any endpoints that have certain GF patterns matched. Clean your scan results and screenshots I understand most of you run reNgine on your VPS, and it is very understandable that you wish to clean scan results, screenshots to save up some space. reNgine now allows you to clean up your scan data and/or screenshots. Enhanced and Customizable Scan alert with support for Slack, Discord & Telegram, also send recon data directly to Discord Notification in the earlier version of reNgine was not very efficient, and support was only for slack. reNgine 1.0 comes with support for Slack, Discord, and Telegram. You will also have an option to customize what kind of notification to be sent, only want vulnerability-related notifications? You can choose that, only want subdomains changes? You can choose them as well. You also have an option to upload these scan data directly to your discord. You can view the complete changelog here: https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md There are a lot more tiny improvements that I worked on for several months that are sure to give you a better experience, and let you stay ahead in the recon game! I really appreciate any feedback and suggestions. \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.3 \u00b6 Release Date: Feb 25 2021 Build error for Naabu v2 Fixed Added rate support for Naabu \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.2 \u00b6 Release Date: Feb 23 2021 Fixed XSS https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/issues/347 \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.1 \u00b6 Release Date: Feb 19 2021 Features Added Discord Support for Notification Web hooks \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5 \u00b6 Release Date: 29 Nov 2020 Nuclei Integration: v0.5 is primarily focused on vulnerability scanner using Nuclei. This was a long pending due and we've finally integrated it. Powerful search queries across endpoints, subdomains and vulnerability scan results: reNgine reconnaissance data can now be queried using operators like <,>,&,| and !, namely greater than, less than, and, or, and not. This is extremely useful in querying the recon data. More details can be found at Instructions to perform Queries on Recon data Out of scope options: Many of you have been asking for out of scope option. Thanks to Valerio Brussani for his pull request which made it possible for out of scope options. Please check the documentation on how to define out of scope options. Official Documentation(WIP): We often get asked on how to use reNgine. For long, we had no official documentation. Finally, I've worked on it and we have the official documentation at rengine.wiki The documentation is divided into two parts, for Developers and for Penetration Testers. For developers, it's a work in progress. I will keep you all updated throughout the process. Redefined Dashboard: We've also made some changes in the Dashboard. The additions include vulnerability scan results, most vulnerable targets, most common vulnerabilities. Global Search: This feature has been one of the most requested features for reNgine. Now you can search all the subdomains, endpoints, and vulnerabilities. OneForAll Support: reNgine now supports OneForAll for subdomain discovery, it is currently in beta. I am working on how to integrate OneForAll APIKeys and Configuration files. Configuration Support for subfinder: You will now have ability to add configurations for subfinder as well. Timeout option for aquatone: We added timeout options in yaml configuration as a lot of screenshots were missing. You can now define timeout for http, scan and screenshots for timeout in milliseconds. Design Changes A lot of design changes has happened in reNgine. Some of which are: Endpoints Results and Vulnerability Scan Results are now displayed as a separate page, this is to separate the results and decrease the page load time. Checkbox next to Subdomains and Vulnerability report list to change the status, this allows you to mark all subdomains and vulnerabilities that you've already completed working on. Sometimes due to timeout, aquatone was skipping the screenshots and due to that, navigations between screenshots was little annoying. We have fixed it as well. Ability to delete multiple targets and initiate multiple scans. Subdomain Takeover (Removed): As we decided to use Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanner, and also, since Subjack wasn't giving enough results, I decided to remove Subjack. The subdomain Takeover will now be part of Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner. \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.4 \u00b6 Release Date: 2020-10-08 Features Background tasks migrated to Celery and redis Periodic and clocked scan added Ability to Stop and delete the scan CNAME and IP address added on detail scan Content type added on Endpoints section Ability to initiate multiple scans at a time \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.3 \u00b6 Release Date: 2020-07-21 Features YAML based Customization Engine Ability to add wordlists Login Feature \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.2 \u00b6 Release Date: 2020-07-11 Features Directory Search Enabled Fetch URLS using hakrawler Subdomain takeover using Subjack Add Bulk urls Delete Scan functionality Fix Windows Installation issue fixed Scrollbar Issue on small screens fixed \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.1 \u00b6 Release Date: 2020-07-08 reNgine is released","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#changelog","text":"This section contains the changes happened in reNgine.","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#backwards-compatibility-check","text":"Please ensure backwards compatibility before updating reNgine.

In a nutshell, 1.0, is feature-packed with a lot of exciting features that are sure to ease your recon game. You may watch the trailer here Introducing Dark Mode, a feature you all have been asking for, is finally here. Recon Data visualization Recon Data visualization is the representation of recon data like subdomain, ips, endpoints, ports, vulnerabilities etc into the visual format like Trees and Charts. Improved correlation among recon data A considerable amount of effort has been spent on making sure that the correlation between recon data is consistent. With this improved correlation, you will now be able to identify recon data like, how many of the subdomains uses X as technology, how many of the subdomains use X.X.X.X as IP, etc. This also means that you will be able to see the number of vulnerabilities that a subdomain has, right from the subdomain table. Ability to identify Interesting Subdomains. reNgine uses certain keywords like admin, cpanel, ftp, dashboard to find what is interesting for you. Users will also be able to add their own keywords and choose conditions like, \"A subdomain in an interesting subdomain if it matches this keyword but also HTTP status is 200\". This allows you to identify what's the most important subdomains to attack against and super useful if you have a very large number of subdomains. Ability to Automatically report Vulnerabilities to Hackerone with customizable vulnerability report. I am excited about the possibilities of Hackerone api, this feature allows you to automatically report the vulnerability to HackerOne if a Critical or High vulnerability is found. Stay ahead of the game! What's exciting is that you also have an option to edit the vulnerability report. To prevent spamming triagers, I've made sure that only Critical and High vulnerabilities are reported. While you will still have an option to manually report the rest of the vulnerabilities. Introducing OSINT Capabilities OSINT is one of the most required features in any recon engine, and beginning 1.0, reNgine comes with OSINT capabilities. This includes support for Dorking, Employees, Emails, Leaked Passwords, etc to be searched. Recon Todo A good recon engine also requires a Todo feature, the idea is that you will be able to recon, add your recon todo or notes right inside reNgine. You will have an option to add todo for your Scan History, for your particular subdomain, or just a TODO! Anything is supported. You can also prioritize by making the Todo important. Proxy Support Proxies are an integral part of any web scraping. Every website has a limit to the certain number of requests for a certain period of time from a particular IP Address that it will allow, exceeding the limit will block incoming requests from such IP Address for a specific period of time. And this is especially true for Dorking and other OSINT reNgine does. After certain Dorking attempts Google is likely to ban your IP for a certain period of time. So using a proxy was a must. Introducing proxy support for reNgine, you will have an option to add hundreds of proxies, and reNgine will pick one of them randomly during the scan. GF support GF is an awesome tool for pattern matching in URLs! A lot of fellow hackers wanted GF support in reNgine. We now bring GF support with an option to upload your own custom GF template. Screenshot Gallery with Filters This probably was the most requested feature in reNgine. A recon engine is incomplete without a screenshot gallery. I am also excited to let you know that, the screenshot gallery also comes with filters, you will have an option to add filters like HTTP status, IP Address, Port, Services, and Technology. And, filters will also come with an autosuggestion feature. Powerful recon data filtering with auto-suggestions Recon data filtering was one of the most important features in reNgine, recon data is huge, and we do not want you to get lost, or spend a lot of time looking for the right recon data. So, presenting you, recon data filtering with autosuggestions. You will now be able to see a search bar in Subdomains Table, URLs, Vulnerabilities Table which will auto-suggest the col names. You can combine multiple queries using &, |, etc. Example gf_patterns=lfi&http_status=200&content_length>0 The possibilities are endless... Recon Data changes, finds new/removed subdomains/endpoints reNgine will now compare your last two scans to find out the recon data changes. You will have an option to send the changes to your notification channels as well. Super helpful while doing continuous monitoring on a target. Inside the scan dashboard, you will now see a separate section for Recon Data changes, which will identify any added or removed subdomains or endpoints. Tagging of targets into Organization There are times when you wish to perform a scan for all the targets that belong to an organization. reNgine 1.0 allows you to tag multiple targets to an organization and initiate or schedule scans with one click. Support for custom GF patterns and Nuclei Templates While nuclei was a part of the earlier release, but there wasn't any easy way to upload your custom nuclei templates. Now, you will have an option to add your custom GF or Nuclei templates right from the UI. You will also have an option to view the template. Support for editing tool-related configuration files (Nuclei, Subfinder, Naabu, amass) Tools like Nuclei, Subfinder uses configuration files to pass API keys and certain tool-related settings. We now bring an option to directly edit tool-related configuration files right from reNgine UI. This means you will also be able to view them. Option to Mark Subdomains as important This is a tiny little feature that will allow you to mark any subdomain as important! Watch out for a star icon on the subdomains table, you'll be able to mark them as important. Separate tab for Directory scan results It is true that directory scan results were breaking the subdomains table, from a UX perspective, it was not a really good idea to show everything in the subdomains table. So, a new tab has been added just for directory scan results. Option to Import and Export Subdomains and export endpoints Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. You will now be able to import subdomains from your private recon tools to any scan before you initiate. You will see this option to import the subdomain just after you choose the scan engine. In the same section, you will also see an option to exclude subdomains. We also now allow you to download subdomains, or just download subdomains marked as important, or just download subdomains that are interesting. This also applies to endpoints, you can download all endpoints, just download any endpoints that have certain GF patterns matched. Clean your scan results and screenshots I understand most of you run reNgine on your VPS, and it is very understandable that you wish to clean scan results, screenshots to save up some space. reNgine now allows you to clean up your scan data and/or screenshots. Enhanced and Customizable Scan alert with support for Slack, Discord & Telegram, also send recon data directly to Discord Notification in the earlier version of reNgine was not very efficient, and support was only for slack. reNgine 1.0 comes with support for Slack, Discord, and Telegram. You will also have an option to customize what kind of notification to be sent, only want vulnerability-related notifications? You can choose that, only want subdomains changes? You can choose them as well. You also have an option to upload these scan data directly to your discord. You can view the complete changelog here: https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md There are a lot more tiny improvements that I worked on for several months that are sure to give you a better experience, and let you stay ahead in the recon game! I really appreciate any feedback and suggestions.","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 1.0"},{"location":"changelog/#053","text":"Release Date: Feb 25 2021 Build error for Naabu v2 Fixed Added rate support for Naabu","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.3"},{"location":"changelog/#052","text":"Release Date: Feb 23 2021 Fixed XSS https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/issues/347","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.2"},{"location":"changelog/#051","text":"Release Date: Feb 19 2021 Features Added Discord Support for Notification Web hooks","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.1"},{"location":"changelog/#05","text":"Release Date: 29 Nov 2020 Nuclei Integration: v0.5 is primarily focused on vulnerability scanner using Nuclei. This was a long pending due and we've finally integrated it. Powerful search queries across endpoints, subdomains and vulnerability scan results: reNgine reconnaissance data can now be queried using operators like <,>,&,| and !, namely greater than, less than, and, or, and not. This is extremely useful in querying the recon data. More details can be found at Instructions to perform Queries on Recon data Out of scope options: Many of you have been asking for out of scope option. Thanks to Valerio Brussani for his pull request which made it possible for out of scope options. Please check the documentation on how to define out of scope options. Official Documentation(WIP): We often get asked on how to use reNgine. For long, we had no official documentation. Finally, I've worked on it and we have the official documentation at rengine.wiki The documentation is divided into two parts, for Developers and for Penetration Testers. For developers, it's a work in progress. I will keep you all updated throughout the process. Redefined Dashboard: We've also made some changes in the Dashboard. The additions include vulnerability scan results, most vulnerable targets, most common vulnerabilities. Global Search: This feature has been one of the most requested features for reNgine. Now you can search all the subdomains, endpoints, and vulnerabilities. OneForAll Support: reNgine now supports OneForAll for subdomain discovery, it is currently in beta. I am working on how to integrate OneForAll APIKeys and Configuration files. Configuration Support for subfinder: You will now have ability to add configurations for subfinder as well. Timeout option for aquatone: We added timeout options in yaml configuration as a lot of screenshots were missing. You can now define timeout for http, scan and screenshots for timeout in milliseconds. Design Changes A lot of design changes has happened in reNgine. Some of which are: Endpoints Results and Vulnerability Scan Results are now displayed as a separate page, this is to separate the results and decrease the page load time. Checkbox next to Subdomains and Vulnerability report list to change the status, this allows you to mark all subdomains and vulnerabilities that you've already completed working on. Sometimes due to timeout, aquatone was skipping the screenshots and due to that, navigations between screenshots was little annoying. We have fixed it as well. Ability to delete multiple targets and initiate multiple scans. Subdomain Takeover (Removed): As we decided to use Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanner, and also, since Subjack wasn't giving enough results, I decided to remove Subjack. The subdomain Takeover will now be part of Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner.","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5"},{"location":"changelog/#04","text":"Release Date: 2020-10-08 Features Background tasks migrated to Celery and redis Periodic and clocked scan added Ability to Stop and delete the scan CNAME and IP address added on detail scan Content type added on Endpoints section Ability to initiate multiple scans at a time","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.4"},{"location":"changelog/#03","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-21 Features YAML based Customization Engine Ability to add wordlists Login Feature","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.3"},{"location":"changelog/#02","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-11 Features Directory Search Enabled Fetch URLS using hakrawler Subdomain takeover using Subjack Add Bulk urls Delete Scan functionality Fix Windows Installation issue fixed Scrollbar Issue on small screens fixed","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.2"},{"location":"changelog/#01","text":"Release Date: 2020-07-08 reNgine is released","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.1"},{"location":"getting-started/","text":"reNgine installation for Hackers \u00b6 If you are a developer and willing to reNgine for contributing or developing new features follow the Getting Started Guidelines for developers.

Attention If you wish to run reNgine on any debian Linux (like Ubuntu), there is a installation script that will ease your docker installation and does required setup for you. Consider using it. Quick Installation You can skip prerequisites if you are running Ubuntu This document is further divided into 3 parts: Prerequisites reNgine Installation Prerequisites \u00b6 reNgine uses several scripts and tools, those tools or scripts rely on various tools to be installed like Go, Python, etc, and to avoid any dependency issues, we decided to use Docker. Using Docker will not only ease the dependency issues but will also ease the installation steps. As a penetration tester, you need not focus on solving the dependencies, installing required tools, etc. With few installation steps, you should be good to run reNgine . reNgine requires docker , docker-compose and make to be installed before you begin installing rengine. Docker \u00b6 Docker provides very good documentation on how to install docker based on your Operating System. You can follow the documentation here. Docker installation on Ubuntu/Linux Distributions \u00b6 Warning The installation steps have been directly taken from Docker Guide with no modification. Update the apt package index and install the below packages sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install \\ apt-transport-https \\ ca-certificates \\ curl \\ gnupg-agent \\ software-properties-common Add Docker official GPG key curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add - Use the following commands to setup the stable repository sudo add-apt-repository \\ \"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\ $(lsb_release -cs) \\ stable\" Finally install Docker Engine sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io Test the Docker by running docker command on your console/terminal. Docker installation on Windows \u00b6 Docker requires Docker Desktop to be installed on your Windows OS. Installing Docker Desktop is as easy as double clicking the InstallDocker.msi installer, downloaded from here . Docker installation on Mac OS \u00b6 Docker requires Docker Desktop to be installed on your Mac OS. Follow the instruction from Docker hub to install Docker on Mac OS . Docker installation on Windows WSL \u00b6 Nick Janetakis has a well written blog and a Video guide on how to install Docker on Windows Subsystem Linux . Please follow the video/blog guide on how to install Docker on WSL. Docker Compose \u00b6 If you're running Docker Desktop you can skip installing docker-compose as docker-compose comes along with Docker Desktop. This applies for both Windows and Mac OS users. If you're using Linux distributions or WSL, you will still need to install docker-compose and the installation steps are similar. Installing docker-compose on Linux systems \u00b6 Download the latest stable version of docker-compose sudo curl -L \"https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)\" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Apply executable permission sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose Create a symbolic link sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose Verify your installation by running docker-compose --version Info If curl is not working, there are alternate installation steps as well. You can use pip or install as a container. Follow the alternate installation steps . make \u00b6 make installation on Linux Distributions \u00b6 Install the latest version of make using sudo apt install make Although it is optional, build-essential package can also be installed which contains make utility. sudo apt install build-essential All prerequisites are now satisfied. Let's begin by cloning reNgine . Installation \u00b6 Clone reNgine \u00b6 git clone https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine && cd rengine dotenv file \u00b6 Edit the dotenv file using nano .env or vi .env or vim .env . The sample .env file can be found here . # # General # COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=rengine # # SSL specific configuration # AUTHORITY_NAME=reNgine AUTHORITY_PASSWORD=nSrmNkwT COMPANY=reNgine DOMAIN_NAME=recon.example.com COUNTRY_CODE=US STATE=Georgia CITY=Atlanta # # Database configurations # POSTGRES_DB=rengine POSTGRES_USER=rengine POSTGRES_PASSWORD=hE2a5@K&9nEY1fzgA6X POSTGRES_PORT=5432 POSTGRES_HOST=db # # Celery CONCURRENCY Autoscaling # The number of CONCURRENCY defines how many scans will run in parallel # Please always keep minimum of 5 # MIN_CONCURRENCY=5 MAX_CONCURRENCY=30 .env Explained \u00b6 COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME : This will help reNgine name docker containers as rengine_web_1, rengine_celery_1 etc. (Making changes is Optional) AUTHORITY_NAME : SSL Authority Name AUTHORITY_PASSWORD : SSL Authority Password COMPANY : Company Name to generate SSL to DOMAIN_NAME : Domain where reNgine is going to be installed COUNTRY_CODE, STATE, CITY : SSL Speciffc POSTGRES_DB : DB name for Postgres (Making changes is Optional) POSTGRES_USER : Postgres Username for DB auth purpose (Making changes is Optional) POSTGRES_PASSWORD : Postgres Password for DB auth purpose (Please change the default Postgres Password) POSTGRES_PORT : Postgres Port (Making changes is Optional) POSTGRES_HOST : Postgres HOST (Making changes is Optional) MIN_CONCURRENCY : Minimum number of Concurrency for Celery. MAX_CONCURRENCY : Maximum number of Concurrency for Celery. This determines how many maximum number of scans to run in parallel. Determining CONCURRENCY Values \u00b6 Here is the ideal value for MIN_CONCURRENCY and MAX_CONCURRENCY depending on the number of RAM your machine has: 4GB : MAX_CONCURRENCY=10 8GB : MAX_CONCURRENCY=30 16GB : MAX_CONCURRENCY=50 This is just an ideal value which developers have tested and tried out and works! But feel free to play around with the values. Maximum number of scans is determined by various factors, your network bandwith, RAM, number of CPUs available. etc Generating SSL Certificates \u00b6 reNgine runs on https unless otherwise used for development purpose. Using https is recommended. To generate the certificates you can use sudo make certs Please note, while running any make command, you must be inside the rengine/ directory. Build reNgine \u00b6 To build the reNgine, use the following command sudo make build The build process is a lengthy process and expected to take some time. Thanks to Baptiste MOINE for sending the PR that made build process so much simpler. Run reNgine \u00b6 Once the build process is successful, we're good to run reNgine.
