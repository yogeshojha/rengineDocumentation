With this feature, you can create distinct project spaces, each tailored to a specific purpose, such as personal bug bounty hunting, client engagements, or any other specialized recon task.</li> <li>Roles and Permissions: assign distinct roles to your team members: Sys Admin, Penetration Tester, and Auditor\u2014each with precisely defined permissions to tailor their access and actions within the reNgine ecosystem.</li> <li>GPT-powered Report Generation: With the power of OpenAI's GPT, reNgine now provides you with detailed vulnerability descriptions, remediation strategies, and impact assessments.</li> <li>API Vault: This feature allows you to organize your API keys such as OpenAI or Netlas API keys.</li> <li>GPT-powered Attack Surface Generation</li> <li>URL gathering now is much more efficient, removing duplicate endpoints based on similar HTTP Responses, having the same content_lenth, or page_title. Custom duplicate fields can also be set from the scan engine configuration.</li> <li>URL Path filtering while initiating scan: For instance, if we want to scan only endpoints starting with https://example.com/start/, we can pass the /start as a path filter while starting the scan. @ocervell</li> <li>Expanding Target Concept: reNgine 2.0 now accepts IPs, URLS, etc as targets. (#678, #658) Excellent work by @ocervell</li> <li>A ton of refactoring on reNgine's core to improve scan efficiency. Massive kudos to @ocervell</li> <li>Created a custom celery workflow to be able to run several tasks in parallel that are not dependent on each other, such OSINT task and subdomain discovery will run in parallel, and directory and file fuzzing, vulnerability scan, screenshot gathering etc. will run in parallel after port scan or url fetching is completed. This will increase the efficiency of scans and instead of having one long flow of tasks, they can run independently on their own. @ocervell</li> <li>Refactored all tasks to run asynchronously @ocervell</li> <li>Added a stream_command that allows to read the output of a command live: this means the UI is updated with results while the command runs and does not have to wait until the task completes. Excellent work by @ocervell</li> <li>Pwndb is now replaced by h8mail. @ocervell</li> <li>Group Scan Results: reNgine 2.0 allows to group of subdomains based on similar page titles and HTTP status, and also vulnerability grouping based on the same vulnerability title and severity.</li> <li>Added Support for Nmap: reNgine 2.0 allows to run Nmap scripts and vuln scans on ports found by Naabu. @ocervell</li> <li>Added support for Shared Scan Variables in Scan Engine Configuration:<ul> <li><code>enable_http_crawl</code>: (true/false) You can disable it to be more stealthy or focus on something different than HTTP</li> <li><code>timeout</code>: set timeout for all tasks</li> <li><code>rate_limit</code>: set rate limit for all tasks</li> <li><code>retries</code>: set retries for all tasks</li> <li><code>custom_header</code>: set the custom header for all tasks</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Dalfox for XSS Vulnerability Scan</li> <li>Added CRLFuzz for CRLF Vulnerability Scan</li> <li>Added S3Scanner for scanning misconfigured S3 buckets</li> <li>Improve OSINT Dork results, now detects admin panels, login pages and dashboards</li> <li>Added Custom Dorks</li> <li>Improved UI for vulnerability results, clicking on each vulnerability will open up a sidebar with vulnerability details.</li> <li>Added HTTP Request and Response in vulnerability Results</li> <li>Under Admin Settings, added an option to allow add/remove/deactivate additional users</li> <li>Added Option to Preview Scan Report instead of forcing to download</li> <li>Added Katana for crawling and spidering URLs</li> <li>Added Netlas for Whois and subdomain gathering</li> <li>Added TLSX for subdomain gathering</li> <li>Added CTFR for subdomain gathering</li> <li>Added historical IP in whois section</li> <li>Added Pagination on Large datatables such as subdomains, endpoints, vulnerabilities etc #949 @psyray</li> </ul> <p>Fixes</p> <ul> <li>GF patterns do not run on 404 endpoints (#574 closed)</li> <li>Fixes for retrieving whois data (#693 closed)</li> <li>Related/Associated Domains in Whois section is now fixed</li> <li>Fixed missing lightbox css &amp; js on target screenshot page #947 #948 @psyray</li> <li>Issue in Port-scan: int object is not subscriptable Fixed #939, #938 @AnonymousWP</li> </ul> <p>Removed</p> <ul> <li>Removed pwndb and tor related to it.</li> <li>Removed tor for pwndb</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#136","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 1.3.6","text":"<p>Release Date: March 2, 2023</p> <ul> <li>Fixed installation errors.

In a nutshell, 1.0, is feature-packed with a lot of exciting features that are sure to ease your recon game.</p> <p>You may watch the trailer here</p> <ul> <li>Introducing Dark Mode, a feature you all have been asking for, is finally here.</li> <li> <p>Recon Data visualization</p> <p>Recon Data visualization is the representation of recon data like subdomain, ips, endpoints, ports, vulnerabilities etc into the visual format like Trees and Charts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Improved correlation among recon data</p> <p>A considerable amount of effort has been spent on making sure that the correlation between recon data is consistent. With this improved correlation, you will now be able to identify recon data like, how many of the subdomains uses X as technology, how many of the subdomains use X.X.X.X as IP, etc. This also means that you will be able to see the number of vulnerabilities that a subdomain has, right from the subdomain table.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ability to identify Interesting Subdomains.</p> <p>reNgine uses certain keywords like admin, cpanel, ftp, dashboard to find what is interesting for you. Users will also be able to add their own keywords and choose conditions like, \"A subdomain in an interesting subdomain if it matches this keyword but also HTTP status is 200\". This allows you to identify what's the most important subdomains to attack against and super useful if you have a very large number of subdomains.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ability to Automatically report Vulnerabilities to Hackerone with customizable vulnerability report.</p> <p>I am excited about the possibilities of Hackerone api, this feature allows you to automatically report the vulnerability to HackerOne if a Critical or High vulnerability is found. Stay ahead of the game! What's exciting is that you also have an option to edit the vulnerability report. To prevent spamming triagers, I've made sure that only Critical and High vulnerabilities are reported. While you will still have an option to manually report the rest of the vulnerabilities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Introducing OSINT Capabilities</p> <p>OSINT is one of the most required features in any recon engine, and beginning 1.0, reNgine comes with OSINT capabilities. This includes support for Dorking, Employees, Emails, Leaked Passwords, etc to be searched.</p> </li> <li> <p>Recon Todo</p> <p>A good recon engine also requires a Todo feature, the idea is that you will be able to recon, add your recon todo or notes right inside reNgine. You will have an option to add todo for your Scan History, for your particular subdomain, or just a TODO! Anything is supported. You can also prioritize by making the Todo important.</p> </li> <li> <p>Proxy Support</p> <p>Proxies are an integral part of any web scraping. Every website has a limit to the certain number of requests for a certain period of time from a particular IP Address that it will allow, exceeding the limit will block incoming requests from such IP Address for a specific period of time. And this is especially true for Dorking and other OSINT reNgine does. After certain Dorking attempts Google is likely to ban your IP for a certain period of time. So using a proxy was a must. Introducing proxy support for reNgine, you will have an option to add hundreds of proxies, and reNgine will pick one of them randomly during the scan.</p> </li> <li> <p>GF support</p> <p>GF is an awesome tool for pattern matching in URLs! A lot of fellow hackers wanted GF support in reNgine. We now bring GF support with an option to upload your own custom GF template.</p> </li> <li> <p>Screenshot Gallery with Filters</p> <p>This probably was the most requested feature in reNgine. A recon engine is incomplete without a screenshot gallery. I am also excited to let you know that, the screenshot gallery also comes with filters, you will have an option to add filters like HTTP status, IP Address, Port, Services, and Technology. And, filters will also come with an autosuggestion feature.</p> </li> <li> <p>Powerful recon data filtering with auto-suggestions</p> <p>Recon data filtering was one of the most important features in reNgine, recon data is huge, and we do not want you to get lost, or spend a lot of time looking for the right recon data. So, presenting you, recon data filtering with autosuggestions. You will now be able to see a search bar in Subdomains Table, URLs, Vulnerabilities Table which will auto-suggest the col names. You can combine multiple queries using &amp;, |, etc.</p> <p>Example</p> <p><code>gf_patterns=lfi&amp;http_status=200&amp;content_length&gt;0</code></p> <p>The possibilities are endless...</p> </li> <li> <p>Recon Data changes, finds new/removed subdomains/endpoints</p> <p>reNgine will now compare your last two scans to find out the recon data changes. You will have an option to send the changes to your notification channels as well. Super helpful while doing continuous monitoring on a target. Inside the scan dashboard, you will now see a separate section for Recon Data changes, which will identify any added or removed subdomains or endpoints.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tagging of targets into Organization</p> <p>There are times when you wish to perform a scan for all the targets that belong to an organization. reNgine 1.0 allows you to tag multiple targets to an organization and initiate or schedule scans with one click.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for custom GF patterns and Nuclei Templates</p> <p>While nuclei was a part of the earlier release, but there wasn't any easy way to upload your custom nuclei templates. Now, you will have an option to add your custom GF or Nuclei templates right from the UI. You will also have an option to view the template.</p> </li> <li> <p>Support for editing tool-related configuration files (Nuclei, Subfinder, Naabu, amass)</p> <p>Tools like Nuclei, Subfinder uses configuration files to pass API keys and certain tool-related settings. We now bring an option to directly edit tool-related configuration files right from reNgine UI. This means you will also be able to view them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option to Mark Subdomains as important</p> <p>This is a tiny little feature that will allow you to mark any subdomain as important! Watch out for a star icon on the subdomains table, you'll be able to mark them as important.</p> </li> <li> <p>Separate tab for Directory scan results</p> <p>It is true that directory scan results were breaking the subdomains table, from a UX perspective, it was not a really good idea to show everything in the subdomains table. So, a new tab has been added just for directory scan results.</p> </li> <li> <p>Option to Import and Export Subdomains and export endpoints</p> <p>Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. You will now be able to import subdomains from your private recon tools to any scan before you initiate. You will see this option to import the subdomain just after you choose the scan engine. In the same section, you will also see an option to exclude subdomains.</p> <p>We also now allow you to download subdomains, or just download subdomains marked as important, or just download subdomains that are interesting. This also applies to endpoints, you can download all endpoints, just download any endpoints that have certain GF patterns matched.</p> </li> <li> <p>Clean your scan results and screenshots</p> <p>I understand most of you run reNgine on your VPS, and it is very understandable that you wish to clean scan results, screenshots to save up some space. reNgine now allows you to clean up your scan data and/or screenshots.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced and Customizable Scan alert with support for Slack, Discord &amp; Telegram, also send recon data directly to Discord</p> <p>Notification in the earlier version of reNgine was not very efficient, and support was only for slack. reNgine 1.0 comes with support for Slack, Discord, and Telegram. You will also have an option to customize what kind of notification to be sent, only want vulnerability-related notifications? You can choose that, only want subdomains changes? You can choose them as well. You also have an option to upload these scan data directly to your discord.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can view the complete changelog here: https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are a lot more tiny improvements that I worked on for several months that are sure to give you a better experience, and let you stay ahead in the recon game! I really appreciate any feedback and suggestions.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/#053","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.3","text":"<p>Release Date: Feb 25 2021</p> <ul> <li>Build error for Naabu v2 Fixed</li> <li>Added rate support for Naabu</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#052","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.2","text":"<p>Release Date: Feb 23 2021</p> <ul> <li>Fixed XSS https://github.com/yogeshojha/rengine/issues/347</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#051","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5.1","text":"<p>Release Date: Feb 19 2021</p> <p>Features</p> <ul> <li>Added Discord Support for Notification Web hooks</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#05","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.5","text":"<p>Release Date: 29 Nov 2020</p> <ul> <li> <p>Nuclei Integration: v0.5 is primarily focused on vulnerability scanner using Nuclei.

This is extremely useful in querying the recon data. More details can be found at Instructions to perform Queries on Recon data</p> </li> <li> <p>Out of scope options: Many of you have been asking for out of scope option. Thanks to Valerio Brussani for his pull request which made it possible for out of scope options. Please check the documentation on how to define out of scope options.</p> </li> <li> <p>Official Documentation(WIP): We often get asked on how to use reNgine. For long, we had no official documentation. Finally, I've worked on it and we have the official documentation at rengine.wiki</p> <p>The documentation is divided into two parts, for Developers and for Penetration Testers. For developers, it's a work in progress. I will keep you all updated throughout the process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redefined Dashboard: We've also made some changes in the Dashboard.

Some of which are:</p> </li> <li> <p>Endpoints Results and Vulnerability Scan Results are now displayed as a separate page, this is to separate the results and decrease the page load time.</p> </li> <li>Checkbox next to Subdomains and Vulnerability report list to change the status, this allows you to mark all subdomains and vulnerabilities that you've already completed working on.</li> <li>Sometimes due to timeout, aquatone was skipping the screenshots and due to that, navigations between screenshots was little annoying. We have fixed it as well.</li> <li>Ability to delete multiple targets and initiate multiple scans.</li> <li>Subdomain Takeover (Removed): As we decided to use Nuclei for Vulnerability Scanner, and also, since Subjack wasn't giving enough results, I decided to remove Subjack. The subdomain Takeover will now be part of Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#04","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.4","text":"<p>Release Date: 2020-10-08</p> <p>Features</p> <ul> <li>Background tasks migrated to Celery and redis</li> <li>Periodic and clocked scan added</li> <li>Ability to Stop and delete the scan</li> <li>CNAME and IP address added on detail scan</li> <li>Content type added on Endpoints section</li> <li>Ability to initiate multiple scans at a time</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#03","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.3","text":"<p>Release Date: 2020-07-21</p> <p>Features</p> <ul> <li>YAML based Customization Engine</li> <li>Ability to add wordlists</li> <li>Login Feature</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#02","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.2","text":"<p>Release Date: 2020-07-11</p> <p>Features</p> <ul> <li>Directory Search Enabled</li> <li>Fetch URLS using hakrawler</li> <li>Subdomain takeover using Subjack</li> <li>Add Bulk urls</li> <li>Delete Scan functionality</li> </ul> <p>Fix</p> <ul> <li>Windows Installation issue fixed</li> <li>Scrollbar Issue on small screens fixed</li> </ul>"},{"location":"changelog/#01","title":"\ud83c\udff7\ufe0f 0.1","text":"<p>Release Date: 2020-07-08</p> <p>reNgine is released</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/","title":"reNgine installation for Hackers","text":"<p>This section aims to answer some of the most frequently asked questions on installing reNgine.</p> <p>Attention</p> <p>It is recommended that you follow each steps to avoid encountering any errors/issues during the setup.</p> <p>This guide is divided into several sections based on the frequently asked questions:</p> <ul> <li>Running reNgine on local machine</li> <li>Running reNgine on VPS</li> <li>Running reNgine with your own managed database</li> </ul>"},{"location":"getting-started/#quick-installation","title":"\u26a1 Quick Installation","text":"<p>If you are on Ubuntu/VPS/Linux, install script is provided for quick installation.</p> <p>Follow \u26a1 Quick Installation instructions.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/#running-rengine-on-local-machine","title":"Running reNgine on local machine","text":"<p>Running reNgine on local machine is a very straight forward process.
