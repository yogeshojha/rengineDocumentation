## Introduction

reNgine is a web application reconnaissance suite with focus on highly configurable streamlined recon process via Engines, recon data correlation, continuous monitoring, recon data backed by database and simple yet intuitive User Interface.

reNgine makes it easy for penetration testers and security auditors to gather reconnaissance data with minimal configuration.

<strong>reNgine just makes recon effortless.</strong>

## Description

reNgine is a web application reconnaissance suite with a focus on a highly configurable streamlined recon process. reNgine is backed by a database, with data correlation and organization, the custom query ‚Äúlike‚Äù language for recon data filtering, reNgine aims to address the shortcomings of traditional recon workflow.

Developers behind the reNgine understand that recon data can be huge, manually looking up for entries to attack could be cumbersome, with features like identifying Interesting Subdomains, it helps penetration testers focus on attack rather than recon.

reNgine is also focused on continuous monitoring. Penetration testers can choose to schedule the scan at periodic intervals, get notified on notification channels like Discord, Slack, and Telegram for any new subdomains or vulnerabilities identified, or any recon data changes.

Interoperability is something every recon tool needs, and reNgine is no different. Beginning reNgine 1.0, we additionally developed features such as import and export subdomains, endpoints, GF pattern matched endpoints, etc. This will allow you to use your favorite recon workflow in conjunction with reNgine.

PDF reports are something every individual or a team needs. Beginning reNgine 1.1, reNgine also comes with option to download PDF reports. One can also choose the type of report, Full Scan Report or just reconnaissance report. Also, we understand that PDF reports needs to be customizable. Choose the color of report you like, customize the executive summary, etc.

reNgine features Highly configurable scan engines based on YAML, that allows penetration testers to create as many recon engines as they want of their choice, configure as they wish, and use it against any targets for the scan. These engines allow penetration testers to use tools of their choice, the configuration of their choice. Out of the box, reNgine comes with several scan engines like Full Scan, Passive Scan, Screenshot gathering, OSINT Engine, etc.

Our focus has always been on finding the right recon data with very minimal effort. After having several discussions with fellow hackers/pentesters, screenshots gallery was a must, reNgine also comes with a screenshot gallery, and what's exciting than having a screenshot gallery with filters, filter screenshots with HTTP status, technology, ports, and services.

We also want our fellow hackers to stay ahead of the game, reNgine also comes with automatic vulnerability reporting (currently only Hackerone is supported, other platforms may come soon). This allows hackers to define their own vulnerability report template and reNgine will do the rest of the job to report vulnerability as soon as it is identified.

## Support

Over the last few years I have been working insane on reNgine to bring new features with the only goal to make this as De-facto standard for reconnaissance. Most of my out of office hours and weekends are spent on working on reNgine. I do this with addition to my primary job. I am happy to have received such an overwhelming support from community. But to keep this project alive, I am seeking financial support.
