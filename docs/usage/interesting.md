reNgine can identify interesting subdomains based on certain keywords. While some of the keywords come by default, you also have an option to enter custom keywords, that are likely to be your interest.

If any of these keywords are matched, reNgine will classify them as interesting subdomains. You can also choose where to lookup, **Subdomain Name** or **Page Title** or both.

You can also choose to lookup only if subdomain HTTP status is 200, OK.
