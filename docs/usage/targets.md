**Target** could be a domain or a subdomain, that you wish to perform recon. Having a target is a must and a basic requirement to run any scan.

To add the **Target**, navigate to the top navigation menu and click on **Targets**.

Team handle is used to automatically report vulnerability to a program on hackerone. This is the identifier of the program.
Also can be identified by the URL hackerone.com/team_handle, **Use this only if you want to report the vulnerability to Hackerone.** [More information on how to use automatic vulnerability reporting can be found here.](hackerone.md)

Enter the IP and click on Resolve IP Address button.
